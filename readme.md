## Lecture Slides Repository

Welcome to the Lecture Slides Repository! This repository provides a framework for creating engaging and interactive lecture slides using the reveal.js presentation framework. It also includes documentation for all previous lecture sessions, allowing both lecturers and students to easily access and contribute to the educational material.

## Framework Overview

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- **reveal.js template**: This directory contains the reveal.js framework, a powerful tool for creating dynamic and visually appealing presentations.

    - **css**: Stylesheets for customizing the appearance of the slides.
    
    - **demo.html**: An example presentation using reveal.js for reference.
    
    - **dist**: Distributable files for reveal.js, including stylesheets and JavaScript files.
    
    - **examples**: Additional examples showcasing various features of reveal.js.
    
    - **plugin**: Plugins to enhance the functionality of reveal.js.

- **sessions**: This directory holds subdirectories for each lecture session, where lectures are further organized by date. Each session folder contains the actual slides in various formats (e.g., PDF, PowerPoint).

## Guidelines for Lecturers

### Adding New Slides

1. **Create a New Session Folder**: For each new lecture, create a new folder within the `sessions` directory, using the date and a descriptive title.

2. **Add Presentation Files**: Place your presentation files (e.g., PDF, PowerPoint) inside the session folder. Ensure the files are appropriately named for clarity.

3. **Update README**: If additional resources or important notes are associated with the new lecture, update the README file in the respective session folder to provide context and guidance.

## Guidelines for Students

### Accessing Slides

1. **Navigate to the Desired Session**: Browse through the `sessions` directory to find the lecture session you are interested in.

2. **Choose the Preferred Format**: Select the presentation format that suits your needs (e.g., PDF, HTML).

3. **Download the Slides**: Download the chosen presentation file to access the lecture slides.
